  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations are used routinely to compute atomistic trajectories of complex systems. Systems are simulated in various ensembles, depending on the experimental conditions one aims to mimic. While constant energy, temperature, volume, and pressure are rather straightforward to model, pH, which is an equally important parameter in experiments, is more difficult to account for in simulations. Although a constant pH algorithm based on the λ-dynamics approach by Brooks and co-workers [Kong, X.; Brooks III, C. L. J. Chem. Phys.1996, 105, 2414–2423] was implemented in a fork of the GROMACS molecular dynamics program, uptake has been rather limited, presumably due to the poor scaling of that code with respect to the number of titratable sites. To overcome this limitation, we implemented an alternative scheme for interpolating the Hamiltonians of the protonation states that makes the constant pH molecular dynamics simulations almost as fast as a normal MD simulation with GROMACS. In addition, we implemented a simpler scheme, called multisite representation, for modeling side chains with multiple titratable sites, such as imidazole rings. This scheme, which is based on constraining the sum of the λ-coordinates, not only reduces the complexity associated with parametrizing the intramolecular interactions between the sites but also is easily extendable to other molecules with multiple titratable sites. With the combination of a more efficient interpolation scheme and multisite representation of titratable groups, we anticipate a rapid uptake of constant pH molecular dynamics simulations within the GROMACS user community.},

  abstract = {We propose a new approach for force field optimizations which aims at reproducing dynamics characteristics using biomolecular MD simulations, in addition to improved prediction of motionally averaged structural properties available from experiment. As the source of experimental data for dynamics fittings, we use 13C NMR spin‐lattice relaxation times T1 of backbone and sidechain carbons, which allow to determine correlation times of both overall molecular and intramolecular motions. For structural fittings, we use motionally averaged experimental values of NMR J couplings. The proline residue and its derivative 4‐hydroxyproline with relatively simple cyclic structure and sidechain dynamics were chosen for the assessment of the new approach in this work. Initially, grid search and simplexed MD simulations identified large number of parameter sets which fit equally well experimental J couplings. Using the Arrhenius‐type relationship between the force constant and the correlation time, the available MD data for a series of parameter sets were analyzed to predict the value of the force constant that best reproduces experimental timescale of the sidechain dynamics. Verification of the new force‐field (termed as AMBER99SB‐ILDNP) against NMR J couplings and correlation times showed consistent and significant improvements compared to the original force field in reproducing both structural and dynamics properties. The results suggest that matching experimental timescales of motions together with motionally averaged characteristics is the valid approach for force field parameter optimization. Such a comprehensive approach is not restricted to cyclic residues and can be extended to other amino acid residues, as well as to the backbone.

  abstract = {Scurvy is a thousand-year-old stereotypical disease characterized by apathy, weakness, easy bruising with tiny or large skin hemorrhages, friable bleeding gums, and swollen legs. Untreated patients may die. In the last five centuries sailors and some ships' doctors used oranges and lemons to cure and prevent scurvy, yet university-trained European physicians with no experience of either the disease or its cure by citrus fruits persisted in reviews of the extensive but conflicting literature. In the 20th century scurvy was shown to be due to a deficiency of the essential food factor ascorbic acid. This vitamin C was synthesized, and in adequate quantities it completely prevents and completely cures the disease, which is now rare. The protagonist of this medical history was James Lind. His report of a prospective controlled therapeutic trial in 1747 preceded by a half-century the British Navy's prevention and cure of scurvy by citrus fruits. After lime-juice was unwittingly substituted for lemon juice in about 1860, the disease returned, especially among sailors on polar explorations. In recent decades revisionist historians have challenged normative accounts, including that of scurvy, and the historicity of Lind's trial. It is therefore timely to reassess systematically the strengths and weaknesses of the canonical saga.},

This functional performs significantly better than previous functionals with gradient corrections only, and fits experimental atomization energies with an impressively small average absolute deviation of 2.4 kcal/mol.},

Two models are developed for predicting the rate of bond formation between cells and are compared with experiments. The force required to separate two cells is shown to be greater than the expected electrical forces between cells, and of the same order of magnitude as the forces required to pull gangliosides and perhaps some integral membrane proteins out of the cell membrane.},

  abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

Describing causal relationships between muscle forces, tissue stresses, and pain is difficult due to the inability to directly measure these variables in vivo. The purpose of this study was to estimate quadriceps forces during walking and running in a group of male and female patients with patellofemoral pain (n=27, 16 female; 11 male) and compare these to pain-free controls (n=16, 8 female; 8 male). Subjects walked and ran at self-selected speeds in a gait laboratory. Lower limb kinematics and electromyography (EMG) data were input to an EMG-driven musculoskeletal model of the knee, which was scaled and calibrated to each individual to estimate forces in 10 muscles surrounding the joint. Compared to controls, the patellofemoral pain group had greater co-contraction of quadriceps and hamstrings (p=0.025) and greater normalized muscle forces during walking, even though the net knee moment was similar between groups. Muscle forces during running were similar between groups, but the net knee extension moment was less in the patellofemoral pain group compared to controls. Females displayed 30–50\% greater normalized hamstring and gastrocnemius muscle forces during both walking and running compared to males (p{$<$}0.05). These results suggest that some patellofemoral pain patients might experience greater joint contact forces and joint stresses than pain-free subjects. The muscle force data are available as supplementary material.},

  abstract = {Obtaining the correct balance of secondary structure propensities is a central priority in protein force-field development. Given that current force fields differ significantly in their α-helical propensities, a correction to match experimental results would be highly desirable. We have determined simple backbone energy corrections for two force fields to reproduce the fraction of helix measured in short peptides at 300 K. As validation, we show that the optimized force fields produce results in excellent agreement with nuclear magnetic resonance experiments for folded proteins and short peptides not used in the optimization. However, despite the agreement at ambient conditions, the dependence of the helix content on temperature is too weak, a problem shared with other force fields. A fit of the Lifson−Roig helix−coil theory shows that both the enthalpy and entropy of helix formation are too small: the helix extension parameter w agrees well with experiment, but its entropic and enthalpic components are both only about half the respective experimental estimates. Our structural and thermodynamic analyses point toward the physical origins of these shortcomings in current force fields, and suggest ways to address them in future force-field development.},

  abstract = {During human movement, the muscle and tendinous structures interact as a mechanical system in which forces are generated and transmitted to the bone and energy is stored and released to optimize function and economy of movement and/or to reduce risk of injury. The present review addresses certain aspects of how the anatomical design and mechanical and material properties of the force-transmitting tissues contribute to the function of the muscle-tendon unit and thus overall human function. The force-bearing tissues are examined from a structural macroscopic point of view down to the nanoscale level of the collagen fibril. In recent years, the understanding of in vivo mechanical function of the force-bearing tissues has increased, and it has become clear that these tissues adapt to loading and unloading and furthermore that force transmission mechanics is more complex than previously thought. Future investigations of the force-transmitting tissues in three dimensions will enable a greater understanding of the complex functional interplay between muscle and tendon, with relevance for performance, injury mechanisms, and rehabilitation strategies.},

  abstract = {The molecular conformation of the collagen triple helix confers strict amino acid sequence constraints, requiring a (Gly-X-Y)n repeating pattern and a high content of imino acids. The increasing family of collagens and proteins with collagenous domains shows the collagen triple helix to be a basic motif adaptable to a range of proteins and functions. Its rodlike domain has the potential for various modes of self-association and the capacity to bind receptors, other proteins, GAGs, and nucleic acids. High-resolution crystal structures obtained for collagen model peptides confirm the supercoiled triple helix conformation, and provide new information on hydrogen bonding patterns, hydration, sidechain interactions, and ligand binding. For several peptides, the helix twist was found to be sequence dependent, and such variation in helix twist may serve as recognition features or to orient the triple helix for binding. Mutations in the collagen triple-helix domain lead to a variety of human disorders. The most common mutations are single-base substitutions that lead to the replacement of one Gly residue, breaking the Gly-X-Y repeating pattern. A single Gly substitution destabilizes the triple helix through a local disruption in hydrogen bonding and produces a discontinuity in the register of the helix. Molecular information about the collagen triple helix and the effect of mutations will lead to a better understanding of function and pathology.},

In this approach the velocities of all the particles are rescaled by a properly chosen random factor. The algorithm is formally justified and it is shown that, in spite of its stochastic nature, a quantity can still be defined that remains constant during the evolution. In numerical applications this quantity can be used to measure the accuracy of the sampling. The authors illustrate the properties of this new method on Lennard-Jones and TIP4P water models in the solid and liquid phases. Its performance is excellent and largely independent of the thermostat parameter also with regard to the dynamic properties.},

Consequently, it is vital that their presence in biological samples has to be quantifiable. However, their high activity, very short life span and extremely low concentrations make ROS measurement a scientifically challenging subject for researchers. One of the widespread methods for ROS detection, based on the oxidation of the non-fluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH2) to yield the highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF), was developed more than 40 years ago. However, from its initial application, argumentative questions have arisen regarding its action mechanisms, reaction principles and especially its specificity. Herein, the authors attempt to undertake a comprehensive review: to describe the basic characteristics of DCFH2; to discuss the present views of the mechanisms of its fluorescence formation; to summarize the fluorescence formation interferents; to outline its application in biological research; and to underline its advantages and disadvantages in ROS detection as well as for the methodological considerations that arise during analysis.},

  abstract = {Testing environment is an important factor in the outcome of mechanical tests on connective tissue. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of ligament water content on ligament mechanical behaviour by altering the test environment. Water content of medial collateral ligament (MCLs) from 19 three-month-old New Zealand White rabbits was varied in subsets of ligaments pairs by means of immersion in 2, 10 or 25\% sucrose or 0.9\% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solutions for 1 h. One knee joint was cycled 50 times in the designated solution (experimental), while the contralateral knee (uncycled control) was simultaneously soaked in the same tank. Following cycling, the water contents of both test and control ligaments were determined. Water contents of 22 normal MCLs were determined immediately post-sacrifice and served as ‘normal water content’ controls. Normalized peak cyclic load changes were used as a measure of the viscoelastic behaviour of each MCL. Results demonstrated that only ligaments soaked (but not cycled) in a 10\% sucrose solution had water contents (60.5±2.5\%) which were statistically similar to the 22 fresh normal MCLs (63.9±6.0\%). Ligaments soaked in PBS (74.0±1.3\%) or 2\% sucrose (69.2±2.3\%) had significantly higher water contents compared to fresh normal MCLs. Ligaments with higher water contents (e.g. soaked in PBS or 2\% sucrose) demonstrated greater cyclic load relaxation compared to ligaments with lower contents (e.g. soaked in 25 or 10\% sucrose). Different fluid test environments can significantly alter ligament water content and, in turn, significantly affect ligament viscoelastic behaviour.},

  abstract = {Breakdown of triple‐helical interstitial collagens is essential in embryonic development, organ morphogenesis and tissue remodelling and repair. Aberrant collagenolysis may result in diseases such as arthritis, cancer, atherosclerosis, aneurysm and fibrosis. In vertebrates, it is initiated by collagenases belonging to the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family. The three‐dimensional structure of a prototypic collagenase, MMP‐1, indicates that the substrate‐binding site of the enzyme is too narrow to accommodate triple‐helical collagen. Here we report that collagenases bind and locally unwind the triple‐helical structure before hydrolyzing the peptide bonds. Mutation of the catalytically essential residue Glu200 of MMP‐1 to Ala resulted in a catalytically inactive enzyme, but in its presence noncollagenolytic proteinases digested collagen into typical 3/4 and 1/4 fragments, indicating that the MMP‐1(E200A) mutant unwinds the triple‐helical collagen. The study also shows that MMP‐1 preferentially interacts with the α2(I) chain of type I collagen and cleaves the three α chains in succession. Our results throw light on the basic mechanisms that control a wide range of biological and pathological processes associated with tissue remodelling.},

With osteoarthritis affecting millions of people worldwide, investigations into the structure and, therefore, the ability of AC to act as a load-bearing tissue, are crucial for developing treatments and prevention techniques to limit the degree of severity in this condition. Cryofixation and formaldehyde fixation as well as chemical digestion of the uncalcified regions of AC were used in combination with bright field light, polarised light and scanning electron microscopy to image the structure of adult mouse AC. Chemical digestion of the tissue revealed unique insights into the structure of mouse AC and the high cellular density of the tissue. Tightly packed sheets of collagen fibrils formed the territorial matrix (TM) of the deep zone. These were observed closely surrounding the chondrons, after applying both chemical and cryofixation techniques. The interterritorial matrix (IM), in contrast, was more isotropically arranged. The results of the study have implications for the interpretation of biomechanical functionality of mouse AC with probable applications to other species.},

  abstract = {In biology, molecular linkages at, within, and beneath cell interfaces arise mainly from weak noncovalent interactions. These bonds will fail under any level of pulling force if held for sufficient time. Thus, when tested with ultrasensitive force probes, we expect cohesive material strength and strength of adhesion at interfaces to be time- and loading rate-dependent properties. To examine what can be learned from measurements of bond strength, we have extended Kramers' theory for reaction kinetics in liquids to bond dissociation under force and tested the predictions by smart Monte Carlo (Brownian dynamics) simulations of bond rupture. By definition, bond strength is the force that produces the most frequent failure in repeated tests of breakage, i.e., the peak in the distribution of rupture forces. As verified by the simulations, theory shows that bond strength progresses through three dynamic regimes of loading rate. First, bond strength emerges at a critical rate of loading ({$>$} or = 0) at which spontaneous dissociation is just frequent enough to keep the distribution peak at zero force. In the slow-loading regime immediately above the critical rate, strength grows as a weak power of loading rate and reflects initial coupling of force to the bonding potential. At higher rates, there is crossover to a fast regime in which strength continues to increase as the logarithm of the loading rate over many decades independent of the type of attraction. Finally, at ultrafast loading rates approaching the domain of molecular dynamics simulations, the bonding potential is quickly overwhelmed by the rapidly increasing force, so that only naked frictional drag on the structure remains to retard separation. Hence, to expose the energy landscape that governs bond strength, molecular adhesion forces must be examined over an enormous span of time scales. However, a significant gap exists between the time domain of force measurements in the laboratory and the extremely fast scale of molecular motions. Using results from a simulation of biotin-avidin bonds (Izrailev, S., S. Stepaniants, M. Balsera, Y. Oono, and K. Schulten. 1997. Molecular dynamics study of unbinding of the avidin-biotin complex. Biophys. J., this issue), we describe how Brownian dynamics can help bridge the gap between molecular dynamics and probe tests.},

  abstract = {Tendon's primary function is a mechanical link between muscle and bone. The hierarchical structure of tendon and specific compositional constituents are believed to be critical for proper mechanical function. With increased appreciation for tendon importance and the development of various technological advances, this review paper summarizes recent experimental approaches that have been used to study multiscale tendon mechanics, includes an overview of studies that have evaluated the role of specific tissue constituents, and also proposes challenges/opportunities facing tendon study. Tendon has been demonstrated to have specific structural characteristics (e.g., multi-level hierarchy, crimp pattern, helix) and complex mechanical properties (e.g., non-linearity, anisotropy, viscoelasticity). Physical mechanisms including uncrimping, fiber sliding, and collagen reorganization have been shown to govern tendon mechanical responses under both static and dynamic loading. Several tendon constituents with relatively small quantities have been suggested to play a role in its mechanics, although some results are conflicting. Further research should be performed to understand the interplay and communication of tendon mechanical properties across levels of the hierarchical structure, and further show how each of these components contribute to tendon mechanics. The studies summarized and discussed in this review have helped elucidate important aspects of multiscale tendon mechanics, which is a prerequisite for analyzing stress/strain transfer between multiple scales and identifying key principles of mechanotransduction. This information could further facilitate interpreting the functional diversity of tendons from different species, different locations, and even different developmental stages, and then better understand and identify fundamental concepts related to tendon degeneration, disease, and healing. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

  abstract = {An optic fibre method was used to measure in humans in vivo Achilles (ATF) and patellar tendon forces (PTF) during submaximal squat jumps (SJ) and counter movement jumps (CMJ). Normal two-legged jumps on a force plate and one-legged jumps on a sledge apparatus were made by four volunteers. Kinetics, kinematics, and muscle activity from seven muscles were recorded. The loading patterns of the tendomuscular system differed among the jumping conditions, but were similar when the jumping height was varied. Peak PTF were greater than ATF in each condition. In contrast to earlier simulation studies it was observed that tendomuscular force could continue to increase during the shortening of muscle-tendon unit in CMJ. The concentric tendomuscular output was related to the force at the end of the stretching phase while the enhancement of the output in CMJ compared to SJ could not be explained by increases in muscle activity. The stretching phase in CMJ was characterised by little or no electromyogram activity. Therefore, the role of active stretch in creating beneficial conditions for the utilisation of elastic energy in muscle was only minor in these submaximal performances. The modelling, as used in the present study, showed, however, that tendon underwent a stretch-shortening cycle, thus having potential for elastic energy storage and utilisation. In general, the interaction between muscle and tendon components may be organised in a manner that takes advantage of the basic properties of muscle at given submaximal and variable activity levels of normal human locomotion.},

  abstract = {A novel strategy is reported for sensing chemical bond breakage in hydrogels at low levels of mechanical stress using a mechanochemical reaction cascade to generate fluorescence. Hydrogels are promising substrates and frameworks for cell growth and tissue engineering, particularly for cardiovascular repair and cartilage replacement. For these applications, it is important to maintain careful control over gel mechanical properties so that these hydrogels not only match the properties of the desired tissue for replacement but also retain their integrity for extended periods. Since the failure of hydrogels begins with the breakage of cross-links within the structure, methods are needed to sense these initial events for monitoring the performance of implants. In this work, it was hypothesized that nonspecific covalent bond breakage would produce radicals that would react with water to produce reactive oxygen species, which in turn could activate fluorophores sensitive to these. A series of multiarm poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels were synthesized with a variety of cross-links of different bond dissociation energies. It was found that gels loaded with the masked fluorophore 3′-(p-aminophenyl) fluorescein became fluorescent during compression, even with as little as 5 kPa of pressure. The effect of compression on fluorescence activation was found to depend primarily on the strength of the cross-linking functional group. Future studies include utilizing this system to image mechanical variability in heterogeneous gel structures.}

Soft tissues describe an inhomogeneous and multiphasic structure, and exhibit a nonlinear, time-dependent behavior. Their mechanical response is governed by a substance composed of protein fiber-rich and proteoglycan-rich extracellular matrix and interstitial fluid. Protein fibers (e.g. collagen) give the tissue direction dependent stiffness and strength. To investigate these complex biological systems, the use of mathematical tools is well established, alone or in combination with experimental in vitro and in vivo tests. However, the development of these models poses many challenges due to the complex structure and mechanical response of soft tissues. Methods Non-systematic literature review. Findings This paper provides a summary of different modeling strategies with associated material properties, contact interactions between articulating tissues, validation and sensitivity of soft tissues with special focus on knee joint soft tissues and intervertebral disk. Furthermore, it reviews and discusses some salient clinical findings of reported finite element simulations. Interpretation Model studies extensively contributed to the understanding of functional biomechanics of soft tissues. Models can be effectively used to elucidate clinically relevant questions. However, users should be aware of the complexity of such tissues and of the capabilities and limitations of these approaches to adequately simulate a specific in vivo or in vitro phenomenon.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the relationship between the achilles tendon force and the tendon force estimated from the ankle joint moment (EATF) during vertical jump. A healthy male subject performed the following jumps on the force platform: (a) maximal vertical jump from a squat position without counter-movement; (b) maximal vertical jump from an erect standing position with a preliminary counter-movement; (c) repetitive submaximal hopping on the spot with preferred frequency. The achilles tendon force was measured directly with an implanted tendon transducer in all jumping conditions. In addition the joint moment obtained from the film and ground reaction force was used to estimate the tendon force. Measurements revealed that the achilles tendon sustained high loads during the vertical jumps. The peak values of the real achilles tendon forces were 2234 N, 1896 N, and 3787 N in the squatting, the counter-movement, and the hopping jumps respectively. The achilles tendon forces were about twice the ground reaction force. The estimated achilles tendon force showed almost the same impulses with actual force, especially during hopping. However, estimated force overestimated the actual force during the early plantarflexion phase of jumping and the maximal error of the estimation was relatively large. Relevance The direct measurement of the achilles tendon forces during human movement may open ways to better understanding of the mechanisms of muscle function. Its clinical importance can be seen in its possibility to reveal the true loading characteristics of the muscle—tendon complex in almost any movement situation, including those which are expected to cause injury. The findings can be used for estimation of the true tendon forces from the method of inverse dynamics.},

  abstract = {Collagen forms a characteristic triple helical structure and plays a central role for stabilizing the extra-cellular matrix. After a C-terminal nucleus formation folding proceeds to form long triple-helical fibers. The molecular details of triple helix folding process is of central importance for an understanding of several human diseases associated with misfolded or unstable collagen fibrils. However, the folding propagation is too rapid to be studied by experimental high resolution techniques. We employed multiple Molecular Dynamics simulations starting from unfolded peptides with an already formed nucleus to successfully follow the folding propagation in atomic detail. The triple helix folding was found to propagate involving first two chains forming a short transient template. Secondly, three residues of the third chain fold on this template with an overall mean propagation of \textasciitilde 75 ns per unit. The formation of loops with multiples of the repeating unit was found as a characteristic misfolding event especially when starting from an unstable nucleus. Central Gly→Ala or Gly→Thr substitutions resulted in reduced stability and folding rates due to structural deformations interfering with folding propagation.},

For each state of the system, characterized by a local minimum on the potential energy surface, multiple searches for saddle points are carried out using random initial directions. The dimer method is used for the saddle point searches and the rate for each transition mechanism is estimated using harmonic transition state theory. Transitions are selected and the clock advanced according to the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm. Unlike traditional applications of kinetic Monte Carlo, the atoms are not assumed to sit on lattice sites and a list of all possible transitions need not be specified beforehand. Rather, the relevant transitions are found on the fly during the simulation. A multiple time scale simulation of Al(100) crystal growth is presented where the deposition event, occurring on the time scale of picoseconds, is simulated by ordinary classical dynamics, but the time interval in between deposition events, on the order of milliseconds, is simulated by the long time scale algorithm. The Al(100) surface is found to grow remarkably smooth, even at 30 K because of concerted displacements of multiple atoms with significantly lower activation energy than adatom diffusion on the flat terrace.},

The Quiet Particle-Mesh model (QPM) uses a Gaussian-shaped charge cloud and careful shaping of the potential solution in either real or transform space. The QPM model is measured to be 150 times less noisy than the conventional CIC model and is suitable for large collisionless plasma simulations with 105 or more particles. This is achieved at little or no cost in computing time. The hybrid Particle-Particle/Particle-Mesh model (PPPM), on the other hand, adds to the above mesh calculation contributions from nearby particles by direct summation. This model has a spatial resolution which is independent of the mesh spacing and may be a small fraction of a mesh cell. It is more time-consuming and is suitable for high-resolution sub-Debye length investigations with a smaller number of particles (∼104). Applied to molecular dynamics, the PPPM model can simulate systems with approximately 100 times the number of particles than conventional methods.},

Here, we present a new WHAM implementation, termed g\_wham, which is distributed freely with the GROMACS molecular simulation suite. g\_wham estimates statistical errors using the technique of bootstrap analysis. Three bootstrap methods are supported: (i) bootstrapping new trajectories based on the umbrella histograms, (ii) bootstrapping of complete histograms, and (iii) Bayesian bootstrapping of complete histograms, that is, bootstrapping via the assignment of random weights to the histograms. Because methods ii and iii consider only complete histograms as independent data points, these methods do not require the accurate calculation of autocorrelation times. We demonstrate that, given sufficient sampling, bootstrapping new trajectories allows for an accurate error estimate. In the presence of long autocorrelations, however, (Bayesian) bootstrapping of complete histograms yields a more reliable error estimate, whereas bootstrapping of new trajectories may underestimate the error. In addition, we emphasize that the incorporation of autocorrelations into WHAM reduces the bias from limited sampling, in particular, when computing periodic PMFs in inhomogeneous systems such as solvated lipid membranes or protein channels.},

We perform automated density functional theory (DFT)~calculations at the M06-2X/def2-TZVP level of theory for 42,577 small organic molecules, resulting in 290,664 BDEs. A graph neural network trained on a subset of these results achieves a mean absolute error of 0.58\,kcal\,mol−1 (vs DFT) for BDEs of unseen molecules. We further demonstrate the model on two applications: first, we rapidly and accurately predict major sites of hydrogen abstraction in the metabolism of drug-like molecules, and second, we determine the dominant molecular fragmentation pathways during soot formation.},

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

These methods are exact for systems of slowly varying or high density. For the ground state, they lead to self-consistent equations analogous to the Hartree and Hartree-Fock equations, respectively. In these equations the exchange and correlation portions of the chemical potential of a uniform electron gas appear as additional effective potentials. (The exchange portion of our effective potential differs from that due to Slater by a factor of 23.)

  abstract = {Nitriles are important chemical species in organic transformations, material chemistry, and environmental sciences. Nitriles are used as cyanating reagents in many organic reactions, where the C–CN bond dissociation has an important role. The reactivity of nitriles can be better understood by studying the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the C–CN bond. In this benchmark study, homolytic cleavage of the C–CN bond in 12 nitrile compounds is studied. Thirty-one functionals from eight different DFT classes along with three types of basis sets are employed. Theoretical results are compared with the available experimental data. Based on statistical outcomes, the CAM-B3LYP functional of the range separated hybrid GGA class with Pople 6-311G(d,p) basis set provides the most accurate results for calculating the BDE of the C–CN bond. The mean absolute error (MAE) value is 0.06~kcal~mol−1, whereas standard deviation (SD) and Pearson’s correlation (R) are 2.79~kcal~mol−1 and 0.96, respectively, when compared with experimental data. The substitutional effect on the homolytic cleavage (BDE) of respective bonds in differently substituted nitriles is also investigated. The BDE results indicate that electron withdrawing groups (EWGs) lower the BDE, while electron donating groups (EDGs) increase the BDE of the C–CN bond. The NBO and HOMO–LUMO orbitals analyses are also performed to further elaborate the variational BDE patterns of C–CN bond cleavage.},

The method is presented here as an extension of the Umbrella Sampling method for free-energy and Potential of Mean Force calculations. This algorithm possesses the following advantages over methods that are currently employed: (1) It provides a built-in estimate of sampling errors thereby yielding objective estimates of the optimal location and length of additional simulations needed to achieve a desired level of precision; (2) it yields the “best” value of free energies by taking into account all the simulations so as to minimize the statistical errors; (3) in addition to optimizing the links between simulations, it also allows multiple overlaps of probability distributions for obtaining better estimates of the free-energy differences. By recasting the Ferrenberg–Swendsen Multiple Histogram equations in a form suitable for molecular mechanics type Hamiltonians, we have demonstrated the feasibility and robustness of this method by applying it to a test problem of the generation of the Potential of Mean Force profile of the pseudorotation phase angle of the sugar ring in deoxyadenosine. © 1992 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {A popular strategy for simulating large systems where quantum chemical effects are important is the use of mixed quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics methods (QM/MM). While the cost of solving the Schrödinger equation in the QM part is the bottleneck of these calculations, evaluating the Coulomb interaction between the QM and the MM part is surprisingly expensive. In fact it can be just as time-consuming as solving the QM part. We present here a novel real space multigrid approach that handles Coulomb interactions very effectively and implement it in the CP2K code. This novel scheme cuts the cost of this part of the calculation by 2 orders of magnitude. The method does not need very fine-tuning or adjustable parameters, and it is quite accurate, leading to a dynamics with very good energy conservation. We exemplify the validity of our algorithms with simulations of water and of a zwitterionic dipeptide solvated in water.},

Through numerical calculations on a number of atoms, positive ions, and molecules, of both open- and closed-shell type, it is demonstrated that these formulas, like the original Colle-Salvetti formulas, give correlation energies within a few percent.},

Recent modifications to the Amber and CHARMM protein force fields, for example, have improved the backbone torsion potentials, remedying deficiencies in earlier versions. Here, we further advance simulation accuracy by improving the amino acid side‐chain torsion potentials of the Amber ff99SB force field. First, we used simulations of model alpha‐helical systems to identify the four residue types whose rotamer distribution differed the most from expectations based on Protein Data Bank statistics. Second, we optimized the side‐chain torsion potentials of these residues to match new, high‐level quantum‐mechanical calculations. Finally, we used microsecond‐timescale MD simulations in explicit solvent to validate the resulting force field against a large set of experimental NMR measurements that directly probe side‐chain conformations. The new force field, which we have termed Amber ff99SB‐ILDN, exhibits considerably better agreement with the NMR data. Proteins 2010. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

PET-MAD rivals state-of-the-art MLIPs for inorganic solids, while also being reliable for molecules, organic materials, and surfaces. It is stable and fast, enabling, out-of-the-box, the near-quantitative study of thermal and quantum mechanical fluctuations, functional properties, and phase transitions.

It is shown by this development that the first order correction for the energy and the charge density of the system is zero. The expression for the second-order correction for the energy greatly simplifies because of the special property of the zero-order solution.

The allowed vibrational energy levels are found to be given by the formula 𝐸⁡(𝑛) =𝐸𝑒 +ℎ⁡𝜔0⁢(𝑛 +12) −ℎ⁡𝜔0⁢𝑥⁢(𝑛+12)2, which is known to express the experimental values quite accurately. The empirical law relating the normal molecular separation 𝑟0 and the classical vibration frequency 𝜔0 is shown to be 𝑟03⁢𝜔0 =𝐾 to within a probable error of 4 percent, where 𝐾 is the same constant for all diatomic molecules and for all electronic levels. By means of this law, and by means of the solution above, the experimental data for many of the electronic levels of various molecules are analyzed and a table of constants is obtained from which the potential energy curves can be plotted. The changes in the above mentioned vibrational levels due to molecular rotation are found to agree with the Kratzer formula to the first approximation.},

While atom-centered message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have shown remarkable accuracy, their information propagation has limited the accessible length-scales. Local methods, conversely, scale to large simulations but have suffered from inferior accuracy. This work introduces Allegro, a strictly local equivariant deep neural network interatomic potential architecture that simultaneously exhibits excellent accuracy and scalability. Allegro represents a many-body potential using iterated tensor products of learned equivariant representations without atom-centered message passing. Allegro obtains improvements over state-of-the-art methods on QM9 and revMD17. A single tensor product layer outperforms existing deep MPNNs and transformers on QM9. Furthermore, Allegro displays remarkable generalization to out-of-distribution data. Molecular simulations using Allegro recover structural and kinetic properties of an amorphous electrolyte in excellent agreement with ab-initio simulations. Finally, we demonstrate parallelization with a simulation of 100 million atoms.},

It provides excellent mechanical properties to connective tissue and acts as a protein interaction hub. There is thus a wide interest in understanding the properties and diverse functions of type I collagen at the molecular level. A precondition is an atomistic collagen I structure as it occurs in native tissue. To this end, we built full-atom models of crosslinked collagen fibrils by integrating the low-resolution structure of collagen fibril available from X-ray fiber diffraction with high-resolution structures of short collagen-like peptides from X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry data. We created a web resource of collagen models for 20 different species with a large variety of crosslink types and localization within the fibril, to facilitate structure-based analyses and simulations of type I collagen in health and disease. To easily enable simulations, we provide parameters of the modeled crosslinks for an Amber force field. The repository of collagen models is available at https://colbuilder.h-its.org.},

  abstract = {Calculating interactions or correlations between pairs of particles is typically the most time-consuming task in particle simulation or correlation analysis. Straightforward implementations using a double loop over particle pairs have traditionally worked well, especially since compilers usually do a good job of unrolling the inner loop. In order to reach high performance on modern CPU and accelerator architectures, single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) parallelization has become essential. Avoiding memory bottlenecks is also increasingly important and requires reducing the ratio of memory to arithmetic operations. Moreover, when pairs only interact within a certain cut-off distance, good SIMD utilization can only be achieved by reordering input and output data, which quickly becomes a limiting factor. Here we present an algorithm for SIMD parallelization based on grouping a fixed number of particles, e.g. 2, 4, or 8, into spatial clusters. Calculating all interactions between particles in a pair of such clusters improves data reuse compared to the traditional scheme and results in a more efficient SIMD parallelization. Adjusting the cluster size allows the algorithm to map to SIMD units of various widths. This flexibility not only enables fast and efficient implementation on current CPUs and accelerator architectures like GPUs or Intel MIC, but it also makes the algorithm future-proof. We present the algorithm with an application to molecular dynamics simulations, where we can also make use of the effective buffering the method introduces.},

Host-guest peptides have been used previously to characterize triple-helix propensities of individual residues and Gly-X-Y triplets. Here, comparison of the thermal stabilities of host-guest peptides of the form (Gly-Pro-Hyp)3-Gly-X-Y-Gly-X'-Y'-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)3 extends the study to adjacent tripeptide sequences, to encompass the major classes of potential direct intramolecular interactions. Favorable hydrophobic interactions were observed, as well as stabilizing intrachain interactions between residues of opposite charge in the i and i + 3 positions. However, the greatest gain in triple-helix stability was achieved in the presence of Gly-Pro-Lys-Gly-Asp/Glu-Hyp sequences, leading to a T(m) value equal to that seen for a Gly-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Pro-Hyp sequence. This stabilization is seen for Lys but not for Arg and can be assigned to interchain ion pairs, as shown by molecular modeling. Computational analysis shows that Lys-Gly-Asp/Glu sequences are present at a frequency much greater than expected in collagen, suggesting this interaction is biologically important. These results add significantly to the understanding of which surface ion pairs can contribute to protein stability.},

Using single‐molecule force spectroscopy, we discover that forces of only a few hundred pN accelerate amide hydrolysis 10               9               ‐fold, an acceleration hitherto only known from proteolytic enzymes. The drastic acceleration at low force precedes a moderate additional acceleration at nN forces.

Our findings reveal that, in contrast to previous belief, amide stability is strongly force dependent. These calculations provide a fundamental understanding of the role of mechanical activation in amide hydrolysis and point the way to potential applications from the recycling of macromolecular waste to the design of bioengineered proteolytic enzymes.},

In tendon collagen, high load even below macroscopic failure level creates mechanoradicals by homolytic bond scission, similar to polymers. The location and type of initial rupture sites critically decide on both the mechanical and chemical impact of these micro-ruptures on the tissue, but are yet to be explored. We here use scale-bridging simulations supported by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to determine breakage points in collagen. We find collagen crosslinks, as opposed to the backbone, to harbor the weakest bonds, with one particular bond in trivalent crosslinks as the most dominant rupture site. We identify this bond as sacrificial, rupturing prior to other bonds while maintaining the material’s integrity. Also, collagen’s weak bonds funnel ruptures such that the potentially harmful mechanoradicals are readily stabilized. Our results suggest this unique failure mode of collagen to be tailored towards combatting an early onset of macroscopic failure and material ageing.},

  abstract = {Proteins are exposed to various mechanical loads that can lead to covalent bond scissions even before macroscopic failure occurs. Knowledge of these molecular breakages is important to understand mechanical properties of the protein. In regular molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, covalent bonds are predefined, and reactions cannot occur. Furthermore, such events rarely take place on MD time scales. Existing approaches that tackle this limitation either rely on computationally expensive quantum calculations (e.g., QM/MM) or complex bond order formalisms in force fields (e.g., ReaxFF). To circumvent these limitations, we present a new reactive kinetic Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics (KIMMDY) scheme. Here, bond rupture rates are calculated based on the interatomic distances in the MD simulation and then serve as an input for a kinetic Monte Carlo step. This easily scalable hybrid approach drastically increases the accessible time scales. Using this new technique, we investigate bond ruptures in a multimillion atom system of tensed collagen, a structural protein found in skin, bones, and tendons. Our findings show a clear concentration of bond scissions near chemical cross-links in collagen. We also examine subsequent dynamic relaxation steps. Our method exhibits only a minor slowdown compared to classical MD and is straightforwardly applicable to other complex (bio)materials under load and related chemistries.},

Four collagens are type II membrane proteins that also exist in a soluble form released from the cell surface by shedding. Collagens play structural roles and contribute to mechanical properties, organization, and shape of tissues. They interact with cells via several receptor families and regulate their proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Some collagens have a restricted tissue distribution and hence specific biological functions., Collagens form supramolecular assemblies in the extracellular matrix that help organize and shape tissues.

  abstract = {The development and validation of new peptide dihedral parameters are reported for the OPLS-AA force field. High accuracy quantum chemical methods were used to scan φ, ψ, χ1, and χ2 potential energy surfaces for blocked dipeptides. New Fourier coefficients for the dihedral angle terms of the OPLS-AA force field were fit to these surfaces, utilizing a Boltzmann-weighted error function and systematically examining the effects of weighting temperature. To prevent overfitting to the available data, a minimal number of new residue-specific and peptide-specific torsion terms were developed. Extensive experimental solution-phase and quantum chemical gas-phase benchmarks were used to assess the quality of the new parameters, named OPLS-AA/M, demonstrating significant improvement over previous OPLS-AA force fields. A Boltzmann weighting temperature of 2000 K was determined to be optimal for fitting the new Fourier coefficients for dihedral angle parameters. Conclusions are drawn from the results for best practices for developing new torsion parameters for protein force fields.},

  abstract = {By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve a new state of the art for image inpainting and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, semantic scene synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs. Code is available at https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion .},

Here we provide a detailed investigation of aliphatic liquid systems. For liquids of larger aliphatic chains, n-heptane and longer, the standard GROMOS96 parameter sets 43A1 and 43A2 yield a too low pressure at the experimental density. Therefore, a reparametrization of the GROMOS96 force field regarding aliphatic carbons was initiated. The new force field parameter set 45A3 shows considerable improvements for n-alkanes, cyclo-, iso-, and neoalkanes and other branched aliphatics. Liquid densities and heat of vaporization are reproduced for almost all of these molecules. Excellent agreement is found with experiment for the free energy of hydration for alkanes. The GROMOS96 45A3 parameter set should, therefore, be suitable for application to lipid aggregates such as membranes and micelles, for mixed systems of aliphatics with or without water, for polymers, and other apolar systems that may interact with different biomolecules. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Here we present the deep learning architecture SchNet that is specifically designed to model atomistic systems by making use of continuous-filter convolutional layers. We demonstrate the capabilities of SchNet by accurately predicting a range of properties across chemical space for molecules and materials, where our model learns chemically plausible embeddings of atom types across the periodic table. Finally, we employ SchNet to predict potential-energy surfaces and energy-conserving force fields for molecular dynamics simulations of small molecules and perform an exemplary study on the quantum-mechanical properties of C20-fullerene that would have been infeasible with regular ab initio molecular dynamics.},

  abstract = {The reactive force-field (ReaxFF) interatomic potential is a powerful computational tool for exploring, developing and optimizing material properties. Methods based on the principles of quantum mechanics (QM), while offering valuable theoretical guidance at the electronic level, are often too computationally intense for simulations that consider the full dynamic evolution of a system. Alternatively, empirical interatomic potentials that are based on classical principles require significantly fewer computational resources, which enables simulations to better describe dynamic processes over longer timeframes and on larger scales. Such methods, however, typically require a predefined connectivity between atoms, precluding simulations that involve reactive events. The ReaxFF method was developed to help bridge this gap. Approaching the gap from the classical side, ReaxFF casts the empirical interatomic potential within a bond-order formalism, thus implicitly describing chemical bonding without expensive QM calculations. This article provides an overview of the development, application, and future directions of the ReaxFF method.},

In recent years, E(3) equivariant neural networks have lifted the tension between computational efficiency and accuracy of force fields, but they are still several orders of magnitude more expensive than established molecular mechanics (MM) force fields. Here, we propose Grappa, a machine learning framework to predict MM parameters from the molecular graph, employing a graph attentional neural network and a transformer with symmetry-preserving positional encoding. The resulting Grappa force field outperforms tabulated and machine-learned MM force fields in terms of accuracy at the same computational efficiency and can be used in existing Molecular Dynamics (MD) engines like GROMACS and OpenMM. It predicts energies and forces of small molecules, peptides, and RNA at state-of-the-art MM accuracy, while also reproducing experimentally measured values for J-couplings. With its simple input features and high data-efficiency, Grappa is well suited for extensions to uncharted regions of chemical space, which we show on the example of peptide radicals. We demonstrate Grappa's transferability to macromolecules in MD simulations from a small fast-folding protein up to a whole virus particle. Our force field sets the stage for biomolecular simulations closer to chemical accuracy, but with the same computational cost as established protein force fields.},

There is no treatment of the separations between the various terms of a multiplet, since that has been done elsewhere, but only between one multiplet and another. It is found that Hund's rule, that terms of large L and S values lie lowest, has no general significance; the present theory leads to the same results as the rule when it is obeyed experimentally, but many cases which were exceptions to that rule are in agreement with the theory. The method of calculation of multiplet distances is described in sufficient detail, with the necessary tables of coefficients, etc., so that further checks with experiment could easily be made.},

  abstract = {Tendons are strong hierarchical structures, but how tensile forces are transmitted between different levels remains incompletely understood. Collagen fibrils are thought to be primary determinants of whole tendon properties, and therefore we hypothesized that the whole human patellar tendon and its distinct collagen fibrils would display similar mechanical properties. Human patellar tendons (n = 5) were mechanically tested in vivo by ultrasonography. Biopsies were obtained from each tendon, and individual collagen fibrils were dissected and tested mechanically by atomic force microscopy. The Young's modulus was 2.0 ± 0.5 GPa, and the toe region reached 3.3 ± 1.9\% strain in whole patellar tendons. Based on dry cross-sectional area, the Young's modulus of isolated collagen fibrils was 2.8 ± 0.3 GPa, and the toe region reached 0.86 ± 0.08\% strain. The measured fibril modulus was insufficient to account for the modulus of the tendon in vivo when fibril content in the tendon was accounted for. Thus, our original hypothesis was not supported, although the in vitro fibril modulus corresponded well with reported in vitro tendon values. This correspondence together with the fibril modulus not being greater than that of tendon supports that fibrillar rather than interfibrillar properties govern the subfailure tendon response, making the fibrillar level a meaningful target of intervention. The lower modulus found in vitro suggests a possible adverse effect of removing the tissue from its natural environment. In addition to the primary work comparing the two hierarchical levels, we also verified the existence of viscoelastic behavior in isolated human collagen fibrils.},

  abstract = {Enhancing sampling and analyzing simulations are central issues in molecular simulation. Recently, we introduced PLUMED, an open-source plug-in that provides some of the most popular molecular dynamics (MD) codes with implementations of a variety of different enhanced sampling algorithms and collective variables (CVs). The rapid changes in this field, in particular new directions in enhanced sampling and dimensionality reduction together with new hardware, require a code that is more flexible and more efficient. We therefore present PLUMED 2 here—a complete rewrite of the code in an object-oriented programming language (C++). This new version introduces greater flexibility and greater modularity, which both extends its core capabilities and makes it far easier to add new methods and CVs. It also has a simpler interface with the MD engines and provides a single software library containing both tools and core facilities. Ultimately, the new code better serves the ever-growing community of users and contributors in coping with the new challenges arising in the field. Program summary Program title: PLUMED 2 Catalogue identifier: AEEE\_v2\_0 Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEEE\_v2\_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen’s University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: Yes No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 700646 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 6618136 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: ANSI-C++. Computer: Any computer capable of running an executable produced by a C++~compiler. Operating system: Linux operating system, Unix OSs. Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Yes, parallelized using MPI. RAM: Depends on the number of atoms, the method chosen and the collective variables used. Classification: 3, 7.7, 23. Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEEE\_v1\_0. Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 180 (2009) 1961. External routines: GNU libmatheval, Lapack, Blas, MPI. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: This version supersedes the previous version for the most part. There are a small number of very specific situations where the previous version is better, due to performance or to non-ported features. We are actively working on porting these last few features into the new code. Nature of problem: Calculation of free-energy surfaces for molecular systems of interest in biology, chemistry and materials science, on the fly and a posteriori analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories using advanced collective variables. Solution method: Implementations of various collective variables and enhanced sampling techniques. Reasons for new version: The old version was difficult to maintain and its design was not as flexible as this new version. This lack of flexibility made it difficult to implement a number of novel methods that have emerged since the release of the original code. Summary of revisions: The new version of the code has a completely redesigned architecture, which allows for several important enhancements. This allows for a much simpler and robust input syntax and for improved performance. In addition, it provides several, more-complex collective variables which could not have been written using the previous implementation. Furthermore, the entire code is fully documented so it is easier to extend. Finally, the code is designed so that users can implement new variables directly in the input files and thus develop bespoke applications of these powerful algorithms. Unusual features: PLUMED 2 can be used either as a standalone program, e.g. for a posteriori analysis of trajectories, or as a library embedded in a molecular dynamics code (such as GROMACS, NAMD, Quantum ESPRESSO, and LAMMPS). Interfaces with these particular codes are provided in patches, which a simple script will insert into the underlying molecular dynamics codes source code files. For other molecular dynamics codes there is extensive documentation on how to add PLUMED in our manual. Additional comments: The distribution file contains a test suite, user and developer documentation and a collection of patches and utilities. Running time: Depends on the number of atoms, the method chosen and the collective variables used. The regression test suite provided takes approximately 1 min to run.},

  abstract = {We present a library of Gaussian basis sets that has been specifically optimized to perform accurate molecular calculations based on density functional theory. It targets a wide range of chemical environments, including the gas phase, interfaces, and the condensed phase. These generally contracted basis sets, which include diffuse primitives, are obtained minimizing a linear combination of the total energy and the condition number of the overlap matrix for a set of molecules with respect to the exponents and contraction coefficients of the full basis. Typically, for a given accuracy in the total energy, significantly fewer basis functions are needed in this scheme than in the usual split valence scheme, leading to a speedup for systems where the computational cost is dominated by diagonalization. More importantly, binding energies of hydrogen bonded complexes are of similar quality as the ones obtained with augmented basis sets, i.e., have a small (down to 0.2 kcal/mol) basis set superposition error, and the monomers have dipoles within 0.1 D of the basis set limit. However, contrary to typical augmented basis sets, there are no near linear dependencies in the basis, so that the overlap matrix is always well conditioned, also, in the condensed phase. The basis can therefore be used in first principles molecular dynamics simulations and is well suited for linear scaling calculations.},

  abstract = {To make practical the molecular dynamics simulation of large scale reactive chemical systems (1000s of atoms), we developed ReaxFF, a force field for reactive systems. ReaxFF uses a general relationship between bond distance and bond order on one hand and between bond order and bond energy on the other hand that leads to proper dissociation of bonds to separated atoms. Other valence terms present in the force field (angle and torsion) are defined in terms of the same bond orders so that all these terms go to zero smoothly as bonds break. In addition, ReaxFF has Coulomb and Morse (van der Waals) potentials to describe nonbond interactions between all atoms (no exclusions). These nonbond interactions are shielded at short range so that the Coulomb and van der Waals interactions become constant as Rij → 0. We report here the ReaxFF for hydrocarbons. The parameters were derived from quantum chemical calculations on bond dissociation and reactions of small molecules plus heat of formation and geometry data for a number of stable hydrocarbon compounds. We find that the ReaxFF provides a good description of these data. Generally, the results are of an accuracy similar or better than PM3, while ReaxFF is about 100 times faster. In turn, the PM3 is about 100 times faster than the QC calculations. Thus, with ReaxFF we hope to be able to study complex reactions in hydrocarbons.},

We thus sample trajectories of the stochastic process described by the chemical master equation with time-varying propensities. A comparative analysis shows that existing approaches can either fail dramatically, or else can impose impractical computational burdens due to numerical integration of reaction propensities, especially when cell ensembles are studied. Here we introduce the Extrande method which, given a simulated time course of dynamic network inputs, provides a conditionally exact and several orders-of-magnitude faster simulation solution. The new approach makes it feasible to demonstrate—using decision-making by a large population of quorum sensing bacteria—that robustness to fluctuations from upstream signaling places strong constraints on the design of networks determining cell fate. Our approach has the potential to significantly advance both understanding of molecular systems biology and design of synthetic circuits.},

  abstract = {In this study, we present conformational energies for a molecular mechanical model (Parm99) developed for organic and biological molecules using the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) approach to derive the partial charges. This approach uses the simple “generic” force field model (Parm94), and attempts to add a minimal number of extra Fourier components to the torsional energies, but doing so only when there is a physical justification. The results are quite encouraging, not only for the 34-molecule set that has been studied by both the highest level ab initiomodel (GVB/LMP2) and experiment, but also for the 55-molecule set for which high-quality experimental data are available. Considering the 55 molecules studied by all the force field models for which there are experimental data, the average absolute errors (AAEs) are 0.28 (this model), 0.52 (MM3), 0.57 (CHARMm [MSI]), and 0.43 kcal/mol (MMFF). For the 34-molecule set, the AAEs of this model versus experiment and ab initio are 0.28 and 0.27 kcal/mol, respectively. This is a lower error than found with MM3 and CHARMm, and is comparable to that found with MMFF (0.31 and 0.22 kcal/mol). We also present two examples of how well the torsional parameters are transferred from the training set to the test set. The absolute errors of molecules in the test set are only slightly larger than in the training set (differences of {$<$}0.1 kcal/mol). Therefore, it can be concluded that a simple “generic” force field with a limited number of specific torsional parameters can describe intra- and intermolecular interactions, although all comparison molecules were selected from our 82-compound training set. We also show how this effective two-body model can be extended for use with a nonadditive force field (NAFF), both with and without lone pairs. Without changing the torsional parameters, the use of more accurate charges and polarization leads to an increase in average absolute error compared with experiment, but adjustment of the parameters restores the level of agreement found with the additive model. After reoptimizing the Ψ, Φ torsional parameters in peptides using alanine dipeptide (6 conformational pairs) and alanine tetrapeptide (11 conformational pairs), the new model gives better energies than the Cornell et al. ( J Am Chem Soc 1995, 117, 5179–5197) force field. The average absolute error of this model for high-level ab initio calculation is 0.82 kcal/mol for alanine dipeptide and tetrapeptide as compared with 1.80 kcal/mol for the Cornell et al. model. For nucleosides, the new model also gives improved energies compared with the Cornell et al. model. To optimize force field parameters, we developed a program called parmscan, which can iteratively scan the torsional parameters in a systematic manner and finally obtain the best torsional potentials. Besides the organic molecules in our test set, parmscan was also successful in optimizing the Ψ, Φ torsional parameters in peptides to significantly improve agreement between molecular mechanical and high-level ab initio energies. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

An external force has been previously shown both experimentally and theoretically to act as a catalyst for the scission of a disulfide bond in thiol/disulfide exchange reactions. How the dynamics of peptide hydrolysis, one of the most prevalent biochemical reactions, is influenced by a stretching force was investigated here using combined quantum and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations together with transition path sampling. Our simulations predict mechanical force to only marginally enhance the reactivity of the rate-limiting step, the nucleophilic attack of hydroxide to the peptide moiety, and not to alter the reaction mechanism, even though the peptide bond and its π-electron conjugation is weakened by force. We describe a previously unidentified hydrogen bonded intermediate state, which is likely to play a role in general in base-catalyzed and analogous enzymatic reactions. Our predictions can be directly tested by single molecule stretching experiments.},

  abstract = {As established nearly a century ago, mechanoradicals originate from homolytic bond scission in polymers. The existence, nature and biological relevance of mechanoradicals in proteins, instead, are unknown. We here show that mechanical stress on collagen produces radicals and subsequently reactive oxygen species, essential biological signaling molecules. Electron-paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of stretched rat tail tendon, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and quantum-chemical calculations show that the radicals form by bond scission in the direct vicinity of crosslinks in collagen. Radicals migrate to adjacent clusters of aromatic residues and stabilize on oxidized tyrosyl radicals, giving rise to a distinct EPR spectrum consistent with a stable dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) radical. The protein mechanoradicals, as a yet undiscovered source of oxidative stress, finally convert into hydrogen peroxide. Our study suggests collagen I to have evolved as a radical sponge against mechano-oxidative damage and proposes a mechanism for exercise-induced oxidative stress and redox-mediated pathophysiological processes.},
